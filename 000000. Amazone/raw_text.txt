Peace Was Never An Option
I Got A Lobotomy at claire's
Hot Girls Hit Curbs
lease Be Patient I Am 9 Years Old
Women Want Me Fish Fear Me
The Closer You Get The Slower I Drive
Please Let Me Merge Before I Cry 
No Baby On Board So Please Feel Free to Run Into Me
Honk If Parts Fall Off 
I Love My Rotten Ungrateful Cat
IF You're Going to Ride My Ass at Least Pull My Hair
I Am A Mom Against Vaping
I am Little High Maintenance
If You Honk at Me I Will Kill Myself 
I Hope Something Good Happens to You Today
if you see me hit the curd mind your business
Women Want Me Fish Fear Me Fish
Bestie Please Let Me Merge
the closer you get the slower i drive
I Love My Gay Dog 
Please Let me Merge Before I Start Crying
Peace Was Never An Option
ask me about my explosive diarrhea
Only Gay Cops Pull Me Over
It was Me I Let The Dogs Out
In My Defense I Was Left Unsupervised 
Life is Hard. It's Harder If You're Stupid 
What A Long Strange Trip It's Been
Treat People with Kindness
Please Don't Honk, I'm SENSITIVE
Don't Commit Crime, The Government DISLIKES Competition
if you can read this i'am about to hit my brakes
IF You're Going to Ride My Ass at Least Pull My Hair 
Normalize Hitting the Curb
