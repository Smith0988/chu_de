It's the economy, stupid
A rising tide lifts all boats
Don't put all your eggs in one basket

The stock market is not the economy
You can't eat GDP

Inflation hits hard, wallets feel it
Jobs scarce, bills pile up, stress peaks
Economic woes: Costs soar, wages lag
Wallets thin, prices high; life's tough
Money talks, mine says 'Goodbye'
Broke by Monday, payday seems myth
Bank account low, optimism lower
Economy slumps, dreams take a hit
Credit cards maxed, savings nil
Dollar's whisper: 'I miss your wallet'
Economy frowns, job seekers drown
Wallet's on a diet, shedding bills
Money flies, savings wave goodbye
Job market blues: tough times linger
Recession knocks, optimism rocks

Interest rates ascend; Fed's not-so-funny punchline
Fed's remix: Rates climb, dreams take a nosedive
Bills up, mood down The struggle is real
Economy's rollercoaster: Wallets scream
Jobs scarce, stress high Adulting is hard

Credit cards maxed, savings nil
Broke by Monday, payday seems myth

Wages stall, expenses sprint ahead
