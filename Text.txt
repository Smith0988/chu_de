Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. 
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
Stink, stank, stunk!
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to
I'm speaking in rhyme!
And the Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day
Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. LOATHE ENTIRELY!
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store. 
What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
I must stop this whole thing. 
Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Max, help me... I'm feeling!
It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters, it's who's around it
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store
Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. LOATHE ENTIRELY!
And the Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day
Stink, stank, stunk!
It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters, it's who's around it
Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to
I'm speaking in rhyme!
I must stop this whole thing. 
Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores, welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before
Trim up the tree with Christmas stuff, like bingle balls and whofoo fluff
Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot
