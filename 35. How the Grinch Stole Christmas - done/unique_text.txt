Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
I'm speaking in rhyme!
Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to
And the Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before
Hate, hate, hate. Double hate. LOATHE ENTIRELY!
Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot
Trim up the tree with Christmas stuff, like bingle balls and whofoo fluff
Max, help me... I'm feeling!
What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Stink, stank, stunk!
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores, welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store. 
Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. 
It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters, it's who's around it
He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore
I must stop this whole thing.
