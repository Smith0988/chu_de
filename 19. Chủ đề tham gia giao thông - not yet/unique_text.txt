Keep calm, drive on
Safety first, journey blessed
Blinker fluid, an elusive car necessity
Traffic jams, time nap
In traffic, patience is a virtue
Tailgating, my car isn't a draft zone
Blinkers speak louder than words
Alert today, alive tomorrow
Safe travels, courteous unravels
Yellow light, reflex test forever
Mind your speed, everyone's need
Parallel parking, my car plays Tetris
Seat warmers, the lazy person's yoga mat
Rush won't hush, but courtesy can
Slow down, save lives
Horns, your car's way of joining the conversation
Fender benders, the real bumper cars
No need to race, find your pace
Traffic flow, let kindness show
Self-driving cars, chauffeurs for everyone
Air fresheners, cars' perfume collection
No need to compete, just stay sweet
Cut the rush, avoid the hush
Stop means stop, don't just flop
Overly bright brake lights, unintended fireworks
High beams, because seeing the road is overrated
Parking garages, where cars play hide-and-seek
Impatience costs, patience rewards
Honk therapy, release built-up patience
Tire pressure, cars' daily meditation
Drive-thru lanes, fast food Grand Prix
Mind your manners, drive with banners
Courtesy matters, even in traffic
Cutting lines won't save time
Driving in the rain, aquatic adventure
No distraction, road satisfaction
Mind the gap, close the trap
Side mirrors, vehicles' selfie cameras
Texting and driving, emojis for life
Avoid regret, drive with respect
Shift your gears, drop your fears
Parking lot searches, real-life mazes
Share the road, not the attitude
Cautious driving, worth arriving
GPS rerouting, road trip detours
Gentle acceleration, no frustration
GPS, your guide to discovering scenic detours
Peaceful driving, harmony thriving
Stay alive, don't text and drive
Follow the code, share the road
Courtesy in lanes, no traffic pains
Speed bumps, universe says 'slow'
Red lights, nature's selfie time
Traffic cones, the true road royalty
Turn the key, think safety
Rush hour, the daily sprint marathon
Road safety starts with me
Kindness drives, rudeness divides
Lane courtesy, a driver's priority
Kindness on the road, everyone's code
Stay aware, show you care
Lights on at night, keep things bright
Arrive with kindness, not with blindness
Left turn yields, interpretive dance zone
Mind your speed, no need for greed
Cross with care, it's only fair
Loud music, car dominance
SUVs, the minivan's rebellious phase
Brakes save lives, use them wisely
Bumper stickers, cars' political opinions
Traffic signals, cosmic disco lights
Stay bright, use headlights
Rude honks, no one wants
Car alarms, the orchestra of insecurity
Think twice, be nice on the drive
Gas prices, the real highway robbery
Flash a smile, not just your lights
Potholes, the earth's speed bumps
Gas stations, car debates fuel
Impatience shows, courtesy glows
Gas stations, where dreams of cheap gas go to die
Roundabouts, 'yield' means 'hope'
Mirrors clear, no need for fear
Sunglasses at night, cool
Horn use is not an excuse
Courtesy in motion, a smoother ocean
Look twice, save a life
Safe driving, happy arriving
Mindful driving, life thriving
Keep it steady, hands at ten and two
Cut the aggression, drive with compassion
Don't speed, plant the safety seed
Impatience won't clear the distance
SUVs, because 'compact' is just a suggestion
Swerving, dodging like a pro
Mind the speed, safety is the need
Respect the lanes, avoid the pains
Rolling stops, brakes for weak
Drive with heart, not just a part
Signal your turn, it's a driver's concern
Tailgating tales, where kindness fails
No rush, just hush, drive with a hush
Angry driving, no one thriving
Road rage, the adult version of a toddler tantrum
Patience on the road, lightens the load
Slow lane, scenic life
Tailgaters, personal escort
Arrive alive, thrive and survive
In the car, be a star
Left lane, reserved for aspiring race car drivers
Spare a second, save a life
Seatbelt secure, journey pure
Be alert, don't get hurt
Follow the rules, lose the fools
Lane change, traffic roulette
Parking far, car's walk
Safe driving is always in fashion
Arrive with grace, not in a race
Cut the road rage, engage in sage
No room for rage, just turn the page
Foggy headlights, cars with cataracts
Brake checks, unintentional heart palpitations
Smooth turns, no sudden yearns
Kindness in drive, helps us survive
Tailgating won't make you great
Parallel park perfection, Olympic feat
Cautious driving is smart surviving
Slow drivers in left lane, scenic commuters
Don't be harsh, share the asphalt
Carpool lanes, where friendships are tested
Courtesy on display, every day
Radio commercials, drivers' bathroom breaks
U-turns, life's detour
Arrive alive, drive at five
Seatbelts on, worries gone
High beams, streetlights overrated
Honking, impatience language
Buckle up for the road to life
Stay aware, avoid the glare
Courtesy is the key, set your driving free
Safe distance, road assistance
Flashing high beams, Morse code for 'move'
Turn signals speak louder than words
Don't rush, avoid the crush
Slow down, drop the frown
No signals, cars can't read minds
Respect the lanes, lose the chains
Brake for kindness, not for rudeness
Respect the road, ease your load
Drive safe, arrive in one piece
Windshield wipers, jazz for rain
Parking tickets, city love notes
Signals clear, no need for fear
Singing in traffic, carpool karaoke solo
Hesitate at green lights, life's extended pause
Backup cameras, avoiding driveway drama
Take a break, not a mistake
Turn signals, not mind signals
Eyes on the road, mind in control
Turn signals, cars' secret language
License plates, state-sponsored puzzles
Birds on cars, nature's art installation
Don't be hasty, arrive safely
Lose the hurry, find the worry
Slow and steady, always ready
