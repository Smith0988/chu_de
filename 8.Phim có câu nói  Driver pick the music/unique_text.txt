I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell
I'm not saying it's demons, but it's demons
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I'm full of fun facts
It's not demons, but it's demons
I've been at this for a long time
 I ain't leaving you alone
Just 'cause you're blood, don't make you family
You're going to reap just what you sow
Well, aren't you a sweet little maggot
You're such a nerd
I can haz cheeseburger?
You, me, and Baby makes three
Hey, you there. I saw that
I can fix that
He's got an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other
The road so far..
The family you're born into, and the family you make
The family you make
We got work to do
Saving people, hunting things
Here we go again
I'm not a demon, and I'm not a dick
You know what I'm craving? 
I'm an angel, you ass
It's what we do
I'm gonna need a bigger mouth
Driver picks the music
I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition
I'm not crazy, just a little unwell
You're going to reap what you sow
